# Computer-Vision-Object-Detection

There are two different versions of this project: 

## FRC Game Piece Detector
The first is a computer vision program to detect game pieces in the 2022 First Robotics Competition. It gives the angle and distance to the target.

### Requirments
- Raspberry pi 3 
- RoboRio
- Radio
- Ethernet cable
- Usb Webcam
- The Required hardware to power all of this can be found on this [schematic](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html)
- Rapid React Game pieces

## Object Detector with JavaFX
This is nearly the same program but ported for desktop devices to detect small colored toy balls. This will also give the distance to the target.

### Requirments
- VS code or another IDE
- Java
- OpenCV-455 for Java
- JavaFX

### Extra information

```java
// You have to modify these values for your own camera (they are used to detect and get the distance of your object)
// Note all code shown is from FXController.java

// object width is in centimeters
final double OBJECT_WIDTH = 3.0;

// I used a really quick method of finding this value although does produce good results
final double FOCAL_LENGTH = 625.6;

// FOCAL_LENGTH = (Width_of_Object_in_pixals x distance_away_from_camera) / Width_of_Object
// These values can be measured from any distance away from the camera
//Make sure the distance is the same when finding the values for Width_of_Object_in_pixals and distance_away_from_camera

// Width_of_Object_in_pixals can be found by printing the value of radius[0]*2 on line 217:
double Distance = Math.round((OBJECT_WIDTH*FOCAL_LENGTH)/(radius[0]*2));


// Note you will also have to set the lower and upper bounds of your toy ball's colour
// This can be done on line 157. Note colors are in HSV.

// ========== Set lower and upper colors ==========
Scalar greenLower = new Scalar(29, 86, 6);
Scalar greenUpper = new Scalar(64, 255, 255);

Scalar orangeLower = new Scalar(0, 125, 150);
Scalar orangeUpper = new Scalar(64, 255, 255);
 
Scalar blueLower = new Scalar(98, 86, 43);
Scalar blueUpper = new Scalar(128, 255, 255);

lowerBallColour = orangeLower;
upperBallColour = orangeUpper;

```
### Demonstration:
The ball I will be using is orange. The system here is tested against objects of the same color. When it detects something it will show the distance and put a yellow circle around it
The ball is at the back in this picture with a bunch of imposters.

Another example with a few more objects:

Note the program still sees the imposters, but can filter them out:

Here are some photos but just with the ball removed. The program still doesn't fall for the dummy objects.

Here are two videos testing the accuracy of the distance. The first one is the view from the vision system, the other is from my phone to show the actual distance of the object
